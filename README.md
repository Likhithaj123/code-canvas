project title and description:- Design an intelligent traffic signal optimization algorithm that uses machine learning techniques to dynamically adjust signal timings based on traffic flow patterns, congestion levels, and time of day, with the goal of reducing wait times and improving overall traffic flow.
key features:-Improved Traffic Flow:
The dynamic adjustment of signal timings reduces congestion, particularly during peak hours, ensuring smoother traffic flow. This leads to reduced travel 
times for commuters.
Reduced Vehicle Wait Times:
By minimizing idle times at intersections, the system reduces the average wait time for vehicles, leading to faster commutes and less fuel consumption.
Energy and Environmental Efficiency:
Less idling results in lower fuel consumption and reduced emissions, making cities more environmentally friendly.
Scalability:
The algorithm can be applied to multiple intersections across a city, creating a coordinated traffic control network that enhances overall road network 
efficiency.
Adaptability:
The system is not static; it adapts to changing traffic conditions, including accidents, road closures, or special events. It can handle various traffic patterns, 
from rush hour to night-time flow.
Cost-Effective:
Though initial implementation might require investment in sensors and infrastructure, the long-term savings in reduced congestion, fuel costs, and pollution 
provide significant value
